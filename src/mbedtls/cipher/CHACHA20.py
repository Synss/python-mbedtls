    ChaCha was created by Daniel Bernstein as a variant of
    its Salsa cipher https://cr.yp.to/chacha/chacha-20080128.pdf
    ChaCha20 is the variant with 20 rounds, that was also standardized
    in RFC 7539.

    Parameters:
        key: The key to encrypt decrypt.  If None,
            encryption and decryption are unavailable.
        mode: The mode of operation of the cipher.
        iv: The initialization vector (IV).  The IV is
            required for every mode but ECB and CTR where it is ignored.
            If not set, the IV is initialized to all 0, which should not
            be used for encryption.
        ad: The associated data for ChaCha/Poly mode.
